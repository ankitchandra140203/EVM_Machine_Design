# EVM_Machine_Design
 EVM_Machine_Design in Proteus software
1> Designed a dynamic digital EVM circuit using logic gates to support 4 candidates, maintaining vote counts in real-time during simulation.
2> Implemented single-pulse detection to ensure each button press increments the vote count by one, using counters for each candidate.
3> Developed a logic sub-circuit to determine the winner based on single-bit comparison signals from multiple comparators, displaying results dynamically during simulation.
